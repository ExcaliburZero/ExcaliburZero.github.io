<p><h2>My Art</h2></p>
<p>I'm not a professional artist, but I do digital art as a hobby. I have a little bit of skill in 3D modeling using the program Blender. I also occasionally use Blender to make vector image style artwork as well. Most of my artwork can be found on my <a href="http://excaliburzero.deviantart.com/">DevientART account</a>.</p>
<p>Below are a few of the better pieces of art I have created.</p>
