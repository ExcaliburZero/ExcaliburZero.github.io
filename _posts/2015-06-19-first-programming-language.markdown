Recently a friend of mine asked me to help teach them computer programming. This got me thinking about what the best programming language to learn as a first language is. As you likely already know, this is a question that has been quite highly debated, and doesn't really have one set answer. This led me to wonder what qualities are good to have in a first programming language.

On the subject of best first programming languages, I'm a bit biased. For me, hands down, it's [Python](https://www.python.org/). But many, many people would disagree with me on that for quite good reasons. The question of "What is the best first programming language?" is a question that has no one true answer, as each programming language brings different things to the table. So it's really a matter of determining what are the qualities to look for in a good first programming language.

## What is the purpose of a first programing language?
Before one can try to determine what are good qualities to look for in a first programming language, one must first understand what the purpose of a first programming language is. In my opinion, the purpose of a first programming language is to introduce one to the basics of programming. Essentially it should serve to break the ice, when it comes to coding.

I've often found that one of the main things that deters people from learning computer programming is getting past the initial barrier of learning a first programming language. Once someone can get past their initial fears of programming by learning their first language, they can pick up other languages more easily. So thus a good first programming language should be able to be picked up quickly in order to make that initial barrier as small as possible.

A first programming language should serve to introduce the basic concepts of programming as easily as possible. It should not require one to understand too many different concepts before they can begin to use it. By introducing the user to many of the basic concepts of programming, the user will then be able to learn other, more complicated programming languages more easily.

Essentially, a good first programming language should be relatively easy to learn and be able to introduce one to many of the basic concepts of computer programming.

It is important to preface that a first programming language does not need to be highly applicable. It doesn't have to be a language that after learning it you could make a decent career out of working with it. It just needs to be something that can teach you the basics easily so that you can later go on to learning more complex and useful languages. This doesn't mean that a first programming language shouldn't be one that can be used professionally, however you just shouldn't treat professional usability as a requirement for a first programming language.

While there are many different qualities to look for in a good programming language, in this article I will be discussing only two of them, simplicity and low concept overhead.

## Simplicity
Perhaps the most common reason I've heard as to why someone does not want to try to learn programming is that they believe that it is too complicated. Many people view programming as something that is quite beyond them, and thus they do not even attempt to learn any programming.

As such, one of the most important qualities that a first programming language should have is simplicity. Starting with a simple programming language can make programming seem a lot less intimidating, and it can help to make people more likely to start learning to program.

A language can be simple in a few different ways. Perhaps the more important such ways are through its visual simplicity and syntax specificity.

The visual simplicity of a programming language refers to how simple a programming language looks visually. Visually simplistic programming languages will use less, more straight forward code than other less visually simplistic programming languages. Starting with a more visually simplistic programming language will help to make learning to program seem less intimidating, and thus make it more likely for one to pick up programming.

In general to determine the visual simplicity of a programming language your best bet is to use the Hello World test. Check how many lines it takes to write a program that simply prints out the classic "Hello World". If it takes more than a few lines to do so, then the language is probably not simplistic enough to make a good first programming language.

Syntax specificity is an important thing to take into account when attempting to determine the simplicity of a programming language. Languages with more specific and strict syntax tend to be more difficult to learn as a first language, because they put a lot of focus on the syntax of the specific language, while that focus could be better directed towards basic programming concepts.

Having a simple, less stringent syntax helps to allow one to focus on learning the concepts of computer programming rather than having to worry too much about syntax issues that are more specific to that language. This also helps to make programming more fun, as it reduces the stress of having error messages popping up quite often.

The visual and syntactical simplicity of a programming language are small but important qualities of a good first programming language, as they shape the first impression that the user develops of programming. By learning a first programming language that has good simplicity helps to make programming seem less intimidating, and allows one to be able to more fully focus on learning and enjoying programming.

## Low Concept Overhead
One of the main issues I tend to find with some programming languages that make them less than ideal for being a first programming language is that they have too much concept overhead. Essentially they rely on having the user learn more than a handful of concepts before they can even write their first program.

Ideally, a good first programming language should have very little concept overhead. One should be able to start coding with the language as soon as possible in order to get past the barrier of writing their first program.

If one needs to understand functions, classes, objects, command line arguments, etc. before they can write their first Hello World program, then that's probably not a good first programming language.

{% highlight java %}
public class HelloWorld
{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

I'm looking at you, Java!

Even if the user does not have to understand such concepts at first, and is required to just mindlessly copy and paste code related to such higher level concepts, this can still confuse the user, and thus make the language unideal for being a first programming language.

Having too much concept overhead in the early learning of a programming language will serve to make it more difficult for one to start out with that language. Either through requiring the user to learn several overhead concepts, or through confusing the user by making them copy and paste several important lines of code that they do not understand.

Thus starting out with a first programming language that has very low concept overhead can help to make beginning to learn programming easier, by allowing one to more quickly pick up the language and begin coding in it as quickly as possible.

## Conclusion
A good first programming language should use both simplicity and low concept overhead in order to make learning programming more easy and enjoyable. Through learning a first programming language, one can begin to develop an interest and love for coding. Thus, learning a first programming language should be made as simple as possible, so that more people are able to give programming a good try and hopefully develop an interest in it.

When it comes down to it though, a first programming language is simply just a stepping stone. Many different languages come in and out of style as new, simpler languages are created to be able to better solve problems. The truly important thing about becoming a programmer is not becoming proficient in a specific language, but becoming acquainted with programming in general.

In the end, it doesn't matter what programming language you choose to be your first programming language. Odds are that you are not always going to be coding just with your first language. What matters is developing a genuine interest in programming, regardless of what language your are using.
