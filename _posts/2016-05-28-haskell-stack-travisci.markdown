When I first decided to try switching from using Cabal to Stack for Haskell development, one of the main concerns that I had was with how it would work with Travis CI. I always try to use a CI service with any project I work on in order to double check forany issues that may arise durring development, so I always try to make sure that whatever build tool I use is compatable with the CI service I am using.

Travis CI, by default, uses Cabal when working with Haskell projects. Unfortunately it is not yet able to directly detect and work with Stack projects. A quick search revieled [this page](http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/travis_ci/) on using Stack with Travis CI, however the first time I looked over it I found it difficult to follow. In addition, that page did not cover some aspects of CI services that I use regularly, such as coverage reporting.

After trying a few different things, I was able to come up with a `.travis.yml` file setup that worked for Stack Haskell projects. Here I will show and explain in detail the configuration file I setup and why it is setup the way it is.


## General Description
The Travis CI configuration file needed to be able to do the following things in order to meet my needs:

- Build and test the Haskell project using Stack rather than Cabal
- Generate the project's documentation using Stack to check for errors in documentation markup
- Check to make sure that the package is valid
- Send coverage reports on the unit tests of the package to Coveralls.io

## Installation Steps
In a Travis CI build config, the `before_install` and `install` steps are used to dependencies required for building and testing a project.

Specifically, the `before_install` step is used for installing more general dependencies such as packages. While, the `install` step is used for installing things like libraries that the project depends on.

### before_install
In the `before_install` step, Stack should be installed, along with the required version of GHC and any service programs, such as those that handle coverage reports.

In the config file I put together, the first thing I do in the `before_install` step is download Stack. To do this, I used the process that the Haskell Stack documentation [reccomends using](http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/travis_ci/#installing-stack). Which simply creates a user bin to store the Stack executable, adds that directory to the path, and downloads the Stack executable from Stackage.

```
# Download and unpack the stack executable
- mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
- export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH
- travis_retry curl -L https://www.stackage.org/stack/linux-x86_64 | tar xz --wildcards --strip-components=1 -C ~/.local/bin '*/stack'
```

After downloading Stack, you want to download the proper version of GHC, as well as any service programs. In this case I wanted to install `stack-hpc-coveralls` in order to handle sending test coverage reports to Coveralls.io.`

Downloading the proper version of GHC is handled by Stack's `setup` subcommand, so you just need to run that. In this case I run it and any other Stack commands with the `--no-terminal` flag in order to make the output easier to read in Travis CI's build logs. After that, stack-hpc-coveralls can be installed through Stack as well.

```
# Setup Stack and install dependencies for tools
- stack setup --no-terminal
- stack install stack-hpc-coveralls --no-terminal
```

### install
In the `install` step, normally the project dependencies would be installed. However, I am not sure how this can be done with Stack. In Cabal you can do this by running `cabal install --only-dependencies`, but I have been unable to find out the equivalent command in Stack. Instead, the project dependencies can be automatically installed durring the build process.

By defualt, Travis CI runs the following command durring the install step: `cabal install --only-dependencies --enable-tests`. However, since we are using Stack we do not want it to run that command. Thus we need to override the default `install` step. This can be done by giving a simple echo command in the install step, which doesn't do anything important other than overriding the default step.

```
install:
  # Overwrite the default installation command used by Travis CI
  - echo "Dependencies are installed by Stack in the build process."
```

## Chaching

## The Code
Here is the final resulting Travis CI configuration file I ended up putting together:

```
language: haskell

sudo: false

cache:
  directories:
    - $HOME/.stack

ghc:
  - 7.8

before_install:
  # Download and unpack the stack executable
  - mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
  - export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH
  - travis_retry curl -L https://www.stackage.org/stack/linux-x86_64 | tar xz --wildcards --strip-components=1 -C ~/.local/bin '*/stack'

  # Setup Stack and install dependencies for tools
  - stack setup --no-terminal
  - stack install stack-hpc-coveralls --no-terminal

install:
  # Overwrite the default installation command used by Travis CI
  - echo "Dependencies are installed by Stack in the build process."

script:
  # Build and test the program
  - stack build --no-terminal --coverage
  - stack test --no-terminal --coverage

  # Install and run the system tests of the program, using the program
  - stack install --no-terminal
  - system-test tests/system/tests.json

  # Generate the documentation and check the package validity
  - stack haddock --no-terminal
  - cabal check

after_script:
  # Send a test coverage report to Coveralls.io
  - shc system-test unit-tests
```
