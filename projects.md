In my spare time I have wored on several different, mostly open source, projects. These are some of the various projects that I have worked on.

## Jekyll Helper

Jekyll Helper is a simple GUI for the command line program Jekyll. It helps to make using Jekyll somewhat easier by offering a GUI interface to use instead having to type out commands.
