In my spare time I have worked on several different, mostly open source, projects. These are some of the various projects that I have worked on.

## Jekyll Helper

Jekyll Helper is a simple GUI for the command line program Jekyll. It helps to make using Jekyll somewhat easier by offering a GUI interface to use instead having to type out commands.

I programmed the original code of Jekyll Helper and am the main contributor to its codebase.

Today I'll Code In is a webpage that selects a random programming language for the user to code a program using. It is to be used for amusement and comical effect.

I created Today I'll Code In.

Minetest is an open source voxel-based, sandbox game engine. It is often used to make and play games that are similar to Minecraft and InfiniMiner.

I have made a number of contributions to various mod and games that use the Minetest engine, and have made a contribution to the engine itself.
