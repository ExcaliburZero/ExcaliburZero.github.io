In my spare time I have worked on several different, mostly open source, projects. These are some of the various projects that I have worked on.

Jekyll Helper is a simple GUI for the command line program Jekyll. It helps to make using Jekyll somewhat easier by offering a GUI interface to use instead having to type out commands.

Today I'll Code In is a webpage that selects a random programming language for the user to code a program using. It is to be used for amusement and comical effect.
